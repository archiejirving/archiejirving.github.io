Armada Rotta and its contributors do not support any belligerent engaged in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or acts of terrorism. ","This list only includes destroyed vehicles and equipment of which photo or video-graphic evidence is available. Civilian Cars, Vehicles of Emergency Services (i.e. Ambulances), Derelict Equipment, and Loitering Munitions wont be included in the list. As Police Forces have an active role in this conflict, their equipment losses are included in the list. Equipment will be listed as captured when there is visual evidence that it has been operated / is controlled by an enemy belligerent, or that it is in territory that is controlled by an enemy belligerent. As soon as visual evidence appears that proves equipment has been recaptured or destroyed, the list will be updated accordingly. When a vehicle is captured and then lost in service with its new operator, it will only be added as a loss of the original operator. Vehicles that are recaptured will be removed from the total count, but will remain on the list and will be marked as recaptured.
